<h4>My love for art has been instilled within me since I was a young boy. 
<br>I would say I have to thank my parents for my unique fashion choices and using me as their
  personal model. <br>However, they've created a monster because I literally cant stop thinking 
  of what type of clothing I'll be putting on next.</br></h4>


<h4>Daniel Arsham and Sean Wotherspoon are two creative designers that inspire me every day. <br>They both have worked for multi billionaire companies like Nike and Adidas along with multi platinum musicians.</br> Their thought process and creativite color palette drew me in from the very beginning.</h4>

<h3>My Inspirations</h3>

<h4>Music has always been a huge aspect in my life. I've been inspired by music artists like Jay-Z, Kanye West, Young Thug, <br>Migos, Travis Scott, Billie Eilish, Camila Cabello, The Weekend and many others.</br></h4>
